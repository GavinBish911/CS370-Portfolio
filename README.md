# CS370-Portfolio
Project Overview In this project, I developed a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a real-world problemâ€”navigating a maze to find treasure, akin to a pirate seeking its bounty. The code I worked with includes a mix of provided scaffolding and significant portions I developed myself. Initially, I was given a basic framework that included the structure for implementing a Q-learning algorithm with placeholder functions. I built upon this by designing the neural network, integrating the exploration-exploitation mechanics, and refining the training loop to effectively teach the agent to solve the maze.

Reflection on the Learning Process Throughout this course, I engaged deeply with the core areas of computer science that underpin intelligent systems, particularly the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Computer scientists tackle complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components, which I mirrored in this project by decomposing the maze navigation problem into states, actions, and rewards. The iterative process of designing, coding, testing, and refining the intelligent agent helped solidify my understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical implementation techniques.

Connecting Learning to the Field of Computer Science Computer scientists play a pivotal role in developing solutions that can significantly impact society and various industries. This project is a microcosm of broader computer science applications, showcasing how algorithms can optimize decision-making processes and enhance automation. The ability to design systems that learn from their environment and improve over time is crucial in areas ranging from autonomous vehicles to financial forecasting.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist The approach to problem-solving in computer science involves a systematic analysis of the problem, development of a solution strategy, and iterative refinement. In this project, my method involved:

Analyzing the problem of maze navigation to understand the challenges and requirements.
Developing a strategy that utilized deep Q-learning to address these challenges.
Iteratively refining the solution based on test outcomes and performance metrics.
Ethical Responsibilities As computer scientists, we have ethical responsibilities towards both end-users and the organizations for which we develop solutions. This includes ensuring the privacy and security of user data, designing inclusive and accessible technologies, and being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of our systems. In this project, ensuring the algorithm's decisions were understandable and justifiable was a key consideration, reflecting the broader need for accountability in AI applications.

Use of This Portfolio The documentation and reflection included in this Jupyter Notebook and this README are not just demonstrations of my ability to apply complex concepts but are also resources I intend to revisit. They serve as a refresher on the methodologies and thought processes applicable to future problems I may encounter in the field. This repository will act as a dynamic tool in my ongoing educational journey and professional development in computer science.
